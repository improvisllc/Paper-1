# Statement of Requirements on the Accuracy of Rocket CFD Analysis Using Exterior Ballistics for Example Rocket Models
In the paper, the problem of statement the error margins on rockets' aerodynamic characteristics obtained through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is considered from the point of view of the rocket exterior ballistics, particularly by the estimation of the rocket's flight distance errors and their accepted ranges based on an example. The results obtained in the paper allow stating acceptable error margins on the investigation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the newly developed rockets through CFD analysis based on an example which can be propagated to the other cases of rocket design and development. Using the study presented in the paper as a method, the CFD engineers who work on the rocket design and development can estimate the accepted margin of their analysis of rocket aerodynamics and research solutions to keep the accuracy of their results accordingly.
